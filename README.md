### Project
<a href=https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors”>Project: Landing Page</a> from <a href=“https://www.theodinproject.com/”>The Odin Project Foundations Course</a>. The project was to create a web page from the provided designs. I used CSS custom properties and utility classes to efficiently apply styles to a single HTML file.
